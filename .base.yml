# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"

  # And much more! For more information, visit the docs: https://espanso.org/docs/

  # Game Face AR
  - trigger: ":story"
    replace: "1. As a ____ I need ____ so that  _____\n2. Call Outs\nTechnical Callouts\n3. Assumptions\n4. Risks\n" 

      # Regards

    replace: "Best Regards,\nKrishna"

             import UIKit
             import PlaygroundSupport

             var greeting = "Hello, playground"
             class MyViewController: UIViewController {
                override func viewDidLoad() {
                view.backgroundColor = .blue
                }
             }
             PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = MyViewController()
